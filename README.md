## 🎯 Problem Addressed

Q-commerce delivery workers (Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart) operate on **10-minute delivery SLAs** across India's metro cities. A single weather disruption or curfew can collapse an entire work slot — with no safety net.

Existing insurance products are too slow, too complex, and too expensive for daily-wage gig workers.

```
Workers lose ₹200–500 per disruption event with zero recourse.
```

SwiftShield solves this with automated **parametric income protection**: when a trigger event is detected in a worker's zone, the system validates, approves, and pays out — in minutes, not days — with no manual claim filing.

> **Target Persona:** Zepto, Blinkit, and Swiggy Instamart delivery partners in Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad earning ₹400–800/day.

---

## 🧑‍💼 How It Works — Ramesh's Story

> *Ramesh is a Blinkit delivery partner in Bengaluru's Koramangala zone.*
> *He earns ~₹600/day and has the Shield plan active (₹59/week).*

**8:40 PM, Tuesday.** Heavy rainfall crosses 15 mm/hr in his zone.

```
Trigger detected  →  Pre-filled claim drafted  →  Confirmation prompt shown
```

Ramesh sees on his dashboard:

> *"We detected a heavy rain alert in your zone. Confirm impact to receive payout."*

He taps confirm. In the background:

| ✅ Check | Result |
|---------|--------|
| GPS zone match | Pass |
| Blinkit session proof (active before trigger) | Pass |
| 48-hour cooling window | Clear |
| ML anomaly score | Low risk |

**Within 30 minutes — ₹85 credited to his UPI account. SMS confirmed.**

> 💡 Ramesh did not file a claim. He did not read a policy document. He did not call anyone. **The system did it for him.**

---

## 🌐 Platform Choice: Web App

SwiftShield is built as a **Next.js web application** — not a native mobile app. This is deliberate.

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| No install required | Any device, any browser |
| Rapid iteration | No native build overhead |
| PWA support | Near-native mobile feel |
| Admin dashboard | Better suited to web |

---

## 📄 Insurance Policy

### 1. Coverage Scope

SwiftShield provides **AI-powered parametric income protection** for Q-commerce delivery workers.

```
✅  COVERED     →  Income loss due to verified external disruptions
❌  NOT COVERED →  Health · Accidents · Life · Vehicle damage · Personal negligence
```

---

## 2. Weekly Plan Tiers

<div align="center">

|  | 🟢 Starter | 🔵 Shield | 🟣 Pro |
|--|:----------:|:---------:|:------:|
| **Weekly Premium** | ₹29 | ₹59 | ₹99 |
| **Income Coverage** | 50% | 70% | 90% |
| **Daily Cap** | ₹500 | ₹1,200 | ₹2,000 |
| **Weekly Max** | ₹1,500 | ₹3,600 | ₹6,000 |
| **Triggers** | Rain · Heat | Weather · Curfew | All + Platform Outage |
| **Claim Wait** | 2 hrs | 1 hr | 30 min |

</div>
---

### 3. Parametric Triggers

| ID | Trigger | Condition | Data Source | Payout |
|:--:|---------|-----------|-------------|:------:|
| `T1` | 🌧️ **Heavy Rainfall** | Rainfall > 15 mm/hr | IMD API | **₹85/hr** |
| `T2` | 🌡️ **Extreme Heat** | Temp > 42°C for 3+ hrs | OpenWeatherMap | **₹70/hr** |
| `T3` | 🌊 **Flash Flood** | Flood sensor + GPS zone match | Flood sensor feed | **₹100/hr** |
| `T4` | 🌫️ **Cold / Dense Fog** | Visibility < 50m or temp < 5°C | OpenWeatherMap | **₹70/hr** |
| `T5` | 🚧 **Curfew / Strike** | Govt. advisory + GPS zone blockage | Govt. advisory + platform APIs | **₹90/hr** |
| `T6` | 💻 **Platform Outage** ⚠️ *Pro only* | Platform down > 30 min | Platform status APIs | **₹90/hr** |

> **⚠️ Note on T6 (Pro Only):** In the demo, T6 uses simulated platform status logs. In production, validation uses public status pages (e.g., `status.blinkit.com`), order API failure rate monitoring, and cross-worker signal correlation — if >30% of active workers in a zone stop receiving orders simultaneously, that constitutes evidence of a platform disruption.

---

### 4. Payout Calculation

Payout amounts are dynamically calculated using AI inputs:

- 📊 Worker earnings history
- 🕐 Time slot demand — breakfast / lunch / dinner
- 📍 Location-based order density
- 📱 Platform activity at time of disruption

---

### 5. Eligibility & Exclusions

**To receive a payout, the worker must:**

- ✅ Be **active** (logged into platform) at the time of disruption
- ✅ Be **present in the affected zone**
- ✅ Be **available for orders**
- ✅ Pass all **fraud validation checks**

**Claims will be rejected if:**

- ❌ Worker was not active during the disruption
- ❌ Location mismatch is detected
- ❌ Fraud signals are triggered
- ❌ Duplicate claim is submitted for the same event

**Not covered under any plan:** War · Terrorism · Pandemic · Health · Accidents · Vehicle repairs

---

### 6. Claim Process & Limits

```
Trigger Detected  →  AI Validation  →  Instant UPI Payout  →  SMS Confirmation
```

- **Fully automated** — no manual filing required
- Daily payout capped per plan
- **Weekly max payout = 3× daily cap**

---

### 7. Pause + Credit Wallet

SwiftShield offers a flexible wallet system for gig workers:

- ⏸️ **Pause anytime** — except during an active claim window or disruption
- 💳 **Unused premium** → converted to wallet credit automatically
- 🔒 Wallet balance usable for **future premiums only** — non-withdrawable

**Example walkthrough:**

```
Week 1 premium:    ₹100
Days used:         3 of 7
Unused days:       4
Wallet credited:   ₹60 (pro-rated)

Week 2 premium:    ₹90
Wallet applied:   -₹60
You pay:           ₹30  ✅
```

---

## 🔐 Fraud Detection & Validation Framework

SwiftShield uses a **multi-layer intelligent fraud detection system** — payouts are only made to genuine, active workers.

### 4-Layer Claim Approval System

> Every claim must pass **all four layers** before auto-approval.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1 │ GPS zone polygon match                               │
│          │ Worker must be within 500m of disruption zone        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2 │ Platform activity validation                         │
│          │ Zepto / Blinkit / Instamart API confirms active      │
│          │ session existed BEFORE trigger fired                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3 │ Presence before disruption                           │
│          │ Worker must have been in zone before the alert       │
│          │ Prevents zone entry post-trigger                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4 │ ML anomaly score                                     │
│          │ Claim frequency vs pin-code peer group               │
│          │ Model: Isolation Forest                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Detection Signal Comparison

| Signal | ✅ Genuine Worker | 🚨 Suspicious Behavior |
|--------|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|
| Movement | Continuous, realistic | Static or impossible speed jumps |
| Activity | Active orders | No real order activity |
| Timing | Present before event | Appears only after trigger |
| Claim frequency | Normal for zone | Burst claims or repeated max claims |

### Fraud Ring Detection

Coordinated attacks are flagged by:
- Multiple workers filing near-identical claims (same zone, time window, duration)
- Sudden zone-wide claim spikes
- Cluster analysis on behavioral features

> **⚡ Liquidity Circuit Breaker:** During a burst, payouts are **queued — not rejected** — while fraud analysis runs. Genuine workers' claims are preserved and paid after validation.

### Fairness for Honest Workers

```
Medium-risk claim detected
        │
        ├─→  Soft-hold (NOT outright rejection)
        │
        ├─→  Step-up verification requested:
        │       • Keep location active for 5–10 min
        │       • OR tap one-tap live check-in
        │
        └─→  Claim released after verification passes ✅
```

## 🛡️ Advanced Anti-Spoofing & Adversarial Defense

SwiftShield defends against sophisticated attacks — **GPS spoofing and coordinated ring attacks** — that single-signal systems cannot catch.

### Multi-Dimensional Signal Validation

| Signal Category | What's Checked |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Movement trajectory** | Anti-teleport check · Impossible speed detection · GPS jitter analysis |
| **Network corroboration** | IP geolocation vs. declared zone · ASN & carrier consistency · Latency heuristics |
| **Device integrity** | Mock-location flag · Emulator / rooted device detection · Device fingerprint consistency |
| **Platform activity proofs** | On-duty status from platform API · Last delivery timestamp · Heartbeat continuity pre-event |

> A fraudster who spoofs GPS still needs to pass network, device, and platform checks — **all independently**.

### Duplicate Claim Prevention

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Idempotency key** | De-duplication by `(workerId, triggerType, disruptionId)` — same event can't yield two payouts |
| **48-hr cooling window** | No new claim within 48 hours of last payout |
| **Ring detection** | Near-identical claims across many workers in same window triggers fraud alert |

### AI-Driven Anomaly Detection

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Isolation Forest** | Detects individual behavioral anomalies — no labelled fraud data required |
| **Clustering** | Identifies coordinated fraud groups |
| **Dynamic thresholds** | Tighten during spikes; calibrated per pin-code peer group — not globally |

### Liquidity Protection Mechanism

```
Ring burst detected in Zone X
         │
    ┌────▼────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Payouts QUEUED (not rejected)      │
    │  Fraud analysis runs across claims  │
    └────┬────────────────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Genuine workers  →  Paid in full   │
    │  Fraudulent claims → Rejected +     │
    │  reason logged for audit            │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘

## ✨ Features

### 1. AI-Powered Risk Assessment

#### Dynamic Weekly Premium Engine

Premiums recalculate **every Sunday** using a Gradient Boosting **(XGBoost)** model.

**Model Inputs:**

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Zone flood & heat history | Historical disruption frequency |
| 7-day forecast risk | OpenWeatherMap upcoming data |
| Worker earnings average | 4-week rolling baseline |
| Pin-code claim rate | Historical claims in the area |
| Seasonal event frequency | Strike/curfew patterns by city |
| City-tier risk factor | Metro vs tier-2 weighting |
| Vehicle & platform profile | 2-wheeler / e-bike + platform risk |

**Model Outputs:**
- `weeklyPremium` (₹)
- Top 3 plain-language explanations of pricing factors
- Week-on-week delta with **fairness cap** (no sudden spikes)

> **Cold start:** New workers fall back to a pin-code peer group prior — updated as the worker builds 4 weeks of history.

#### Persona-Based Weekly Risk Score

Each worker receives a `weeklyRiskScore` (0–100):

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| 🌧️ Weather exposure risk | Assigned zone + current season |
| 🚦 Traffic risk | Zone congestion + typical shift timing |
| 📦 Behavior risk | Activity patterns, active hours, delivery volume |
| 🔍 Fraud risk | Claim frequency vs peer group + anomaly flags |

---

### 2. Parametric Automation

#### Real-Time Trigger Monitoring

The trigger engine polls all data sources **every 10 minutes**.

**Data sources:**
- `IMD API / OpenWeatherMap` — rainfall, temperature, visibility, fog
- `Flood sensor feed` — waterlogging + GPS zone cross-match
- `Government advisory API` — curfew and civil strike alerts

Each zone carries an active disruption state:

```
Zone Status: { start_time, severity: green | amber | red, end_time }
```

#### Automatic Claim Initiation

When a **red-alert** disruption is detected, the system automatically:

1. Identifies all active policyholders in that zone on-duty during the trigger window
2. Generates a pre-filled draft claim (trigger type, time window, estimated lost hours)
3. Surfaces a one-tap confirmation prompt on the worker's dashboard

#### Payout State Machine

```
pending ──► approved ──► processing ──► paid ✅
                              │
                              └──► rejected ❌  (fraud detected)
```

- Auto-approved claims: UPI payout via Razorpay sandbox within minutes
- Dashboard + SMS updated on confirmation
- Rejected claims: reason shown with option to appeal
